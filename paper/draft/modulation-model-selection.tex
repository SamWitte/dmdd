\abstract{
It has recently been demostrated that, in the event of a putative signal in future dark matter direct detection experiments, properly identifying the underlying dark matter-nuclei interaction promises to be a challenging task. Given most optimistic expectations for the number counts of recoil events in the coming Generation 2 (Gen2) experiments, even the interaction theories that produce distinct fetures in the recoil energy spectra will be possible to mutually distinguish only if a strong signal is observed simultaneously on a variety of complementary targets. However, there is a wide range of viable theories that give rise to virtually identical energy spectra, and may only differ by the power of the dark-matter velocity dependence. In this work, we investigate how degeneracy between such compeeting models may be broken by considering time information on when the events are recorded in data analysis. For this purpose, we create a suite of recoil data simulations (under a variety of interaction models, including the appropriate levels of Poisson noise, and assuming Gen2 and larger exposures) and perform a Bayesian model-selection analysis on all simualted data sets, evaluating the chance of correct identification of the input model, for a given experimental setup. We find that including information on the annual modulation of the rate may significantly enhance the ability of a single target to distinguish dark matter models with nearly degenerate recoil spectra, but only with exposures beyond the expectations of Gen 2 experiments.}

\section{Introduction} \setcounter{page}{2}

A vast array of independent astrophysical and cosmological observations testify to the existence of a non-baryonic form of matter in the universe. This so-called dark matter (DM) is the dominant source of the gravitational potential wells that dictate the dynamics and structure of the universe. Despite experimental efforts on multiple fronts, including a direct detection program that has now been mature for several decades, efforts to elucidate potential non-gravitational interactions of DM with Standard Model particles have been unsuccessful. 

As the next--generation direct detection experiments that incorporate increasingly sensitive detection technologies come online, they will start to probe the final portions of DM parameter space before encountering the so-called `irreducible neutrino background' \cite{Bauer:2013ihz,Aprile:2015uzo,Agnese:2016cpb,Malling:2011va,Newstead:2013pea,Cushman:2013zza,Billard:2013qya,Ruppin:2014bra,Davis:2014ama,Dent:2016iht}. Generation 2 (G2) experiments that are currently taking data (see e.g.~\cite{Aprile:2015uzo}) may well be on the cusp of important discoveries, as many interesting theories of DM predict scattering cross sections that live in these portions of parameters space. For example, heavy $SU(2)$--doublet and --triplet fermions, such as the Higgsinos and the wino of supersymmetry, are expected to have cross sections of order $\sigma_{\rm SI} \sim \cO(\few\tenx{-48})\cm^2$ (just about an order of magnitude below the current limits \cite{}\sjwtt{Sam, can you add a good citation?}, fixed by their Standard Model gauge quantum numbers alone \cite{Hill:2011be,Hill:2013hoa,Hill:2014yxa}, while a heavy $SU(2)$-singlet fermion, like the bino, is around an order of magnitude lower depending on its coannihilation partner \cite{Berlin:2015njh}. Models with kinematically suppressed tree--level scattering may also be embedded in more complete dark sectors that have loop--level cross sections in this same range \cite{Ipek:2014gua,McDermott:2014rqa,Appelquist:2015yfa,Appelquist:2015zfa}.

Because so many theories can be accommodated in the parameter space that will be imminently probed by a variety of experiments, it is timely to plan for the science opportunities associated with the first detection of DM particles. Most notably, in case of a confirmed detection, understanding the high--energy dark sector dynamics will solely rely on examining low--energy recoils of detector elements and solving the ``inverse problem'' to identify the right underlying description of DM--baryon interactions from the experimental measurements. On the other hand, all the information about the dark sector interactions accessible to these measurements is contained within the coefficients of the ``effective field theory of dark matter direct detection'' (EFT) \cite{Fitzpatrick:2012ix, Anand:2013yka}. This effective description also captures the nontrivial nuclear physics induced by some of the best--motivated UV--complete theories of DM \cite{Gresham:2014vja, Gluscevic:2015sqa} through an exhaustible list of DM-nuclei interactions. It thus provides a systematic framework for classifying and describing a wide variety of DM theories, and we will utilize it in this work. 
 
However, due to Poisson noise and degeneracies in the shape of the recoil spectra amongst different interactions, proper DM model identification presents a difficult task, particularly for a single experiment. Recent studies have shown that discriminating between interactions is possible only for strong signals (with hundreds of observed recoil events), and only when measurements on targets with sufficiently diverse nuclear physics characteristics are jointly analyzed \cite{Gluscevic:2015sqa}. Thus, using energy spectra to break degeneracies in the DM modeling space crucially relies on ``complementary'' nuclear physics characteristics of available target materials \cite{McDermott:2011hx,Peter:2013aha,Gluscevic:2014vga,Catena:2014epa,Catena:2014hla,Dent:2015zpa,Gluscevic:2015sqa,Ruppin:2014bra}, but this alone does not guarantee successful model selection \cite{Gluscevic:2014vga,Gluscevic:2015sqa}.

On the other hand, almost since the dawn of direct--detection--related DM studies, the motion of Earth relative to DM bound in the galactic halo has been predicted to provide a distinctive signature of DM through the characteristic annual modulation of the expected nuclear recoil rate~\cite{Freese:1987wu, Freese:2012xd,Lee:2013xxa,Britto:2014wga,DelNobile:2015nua,Kouvaris:2015xga}. While observables associated with the annual modulation is typically assumed to take an approximately universal form (when expressed in a particular set of variables), recent work \cite{DelNobile:2015tza,DelNobile:2015rmp} has pointed out that non--standard interaction cross sections containing a non--factorizable velocity dependence could produce a modulation signal that is unique to each target element. More generally, a non--trivial velocity dependence in the cross section effectively changes the phase space integral that governs the total event rate in a given experiment, producing a non-standard modulation. Thus, it may be expected that interactions differing solely by the DM velocity dependence of their corresponding cross sections may be properly identified by exploiting information on the modulation of the rate.


Motivated by this argument, here we propose that analysis of time dependence of scattering events can help discriminate between interaction models whose recoil energy spectra are otherwise degenerate on a single target material. Using the method of \cite{Gluscevic:2015sqa}, we evaluate the enhancement in prospects for accurate model selection when the annual modulation signal is analyzed in combination with recoil--energy measurements in the future generation direct detection experiments. 


%Almost since the dawn of the study of direct detection experiments, the annual modulation of the rate \cite{Freese:1987wu} arising from the motion of Earth relative to dark matter bound in the galactic halo has been appreciated to provide a distinctive dark matter signature, as have its higher harmonics (see e.g. \cite{Freese:2012xd,Lee:2013xxa,Britto:2014wga,DelNobile:2015nua,Kouvaris:2015xga}). \sjw{Earth's velocity with respect to the dark matter `wind' is at a maximum around June $1^{\rm st}$ and a minimum around December $1^{\rm st}$. For a fixed low energy threshold experiment, conventional wisdom would suggest that increasing the relative velocity between Earth and the dark matter `wind' should enhance the number of dark matter particles which can produce an observable recoil above threshold, and thus the of maximum of the scattering rate should occur around June $1^{\rm st}$. While this is true at large energies, standard differential cross sections (\ie those satisfying $d\sigma/d\ER \propto v^{-2}$) actually produce a phase flip, such that at low energies the rate is maximized in December. This feature occurs because the differential cross section is enhanced by low velocity scattering. }

%The aforementioned arguments, however, only hold for conventional virialized velocity distributions and standard differential cross sections. The disturbance of phase space from dark matter substructure \cite{Green:2000ga,Gelmini:2000dm,DelNobile:2015nua} and the gravitational influence of the solar system \cite{Lee:2013wza,DelNobile:2015nua} have been shown to a non-negligible impact on the annual modulation, in particular modifying the phase of the modulation. Additionally, it was recently pointed out in~\cite{DelNobile:2015tza,DelNobile:2015rmp} that differential cross sections with higher order dark matter velocity dependence produce a phase at low energies that is roughly $5$ months out of phase with conventionally considered interactions. Furthermore, \cite{DelNobile:2015tza,DelNobile:2015rmp} emphasized that differential cross sections containing a non-factorizable velocity and target dependence can produce a modulation that is unique to each target element. A proper analysis of direct detection data including the time information of nuclear recoils may therefore have the potential to elucidate unique astrophysical processes and atypical dark matter-nuclei interactions. \sjwtt{Note to self, add more citations to the above section}  

%Since the local distribution of dark matter is at this moment poorly understood, we will focus in this work on quantitatively understanding the extent to which including information on the modulation of the rate can enhance the ability of future direct detection experiments to correctly differentiate dark matter-nuclei interactions with approximately degenerate recoil spectrum but distinct time behavior. Interestingly, we find that the additional discrimination power from timing information will allow some of the most popular detector designs to go beyond detection and significantly improve model identification, even for models with approximately degenerate recoil spectra.  This is possible because, as previously mentioned, additional factors of $v^2$ appearing in the differential cross section alters the phase of the modulation. 






In \Sec{sec:dd} we review the calculation of the direct detection scattering rate and discuss how direct detection observables differ depending on the momentum and velocity dependence of the differential cross section. \Sec{sec:procedure} summarizes the models and experiments that we consider in this paper, and introduces the statistical analysis we apply in order to determine the extent to which future direct detection experiments can properly identify the underlying DM model. Results are presented for various future generation experiments in \Sec{sec:results}. We conclude in \Sec{sec:conclusion}.

  

\section{Scattering in Direct Detection Experiments}\label{sec:dd}

\subsection{Direct Detection Observables}

The key measurement of most direct detection experiments is the nuclear recoil energy spectrum---the number count of nuclear recoil events per recoil energy $E_R$, per unit time $t$, per unit target mass,
\begin{equation}
\frac{dR}{dE_R dt}(E_R,t) =  \frac{\rho_\chi}{m_T m_\chi} \int\limits_{v_{\mathrm{min}}}^{v_{\mathrm{esc, lab}}}  v f(\mathrm{\mbox{\bf{v}}},t) \frac{d\sigma_T}{dE_R} (E_R,v) d^3v ,
\label{eq:dRdEr_general}
\end{equation}
where $\rho_\chi$ is the local DM density; $m_\chi$ is the DM particle mass; $m_T$ is the mass of the target nucleus $T$; $\mathrm{\mbox{\bf{v}}}$ is DM velocity vector of magnitude $v$ (in the lab frame); $f(\mathrm{\mbox{\bf{v}}}, t)$ is the observed DM velocity distribution; $d\sigma_T/dE_R=m_T \sigma_T /2\mu_T^2 v^2$ is the differential cross section for DM scattering off a nucleus $T$; and $\mu_T\equiv\frac{m_Tm_\chi}{m_T+m_\chi}$ is the reduced mass of the DM particle and the target nuclide. Integration limits are the minimum velocity a DM particle requires in order to impart a nuclear recoil of energy $E_R$, which for elastic scattering\footnote{We restrict our attention for the remainder of this paper to DM-nuclei elastic scattering, and defer the subject of proper identification of scattering kinematics to later work.} is given by $v_\mathrm{min} = \sqrt{m_T E_R/2\mu_T^2}$, and the Galactic escape velocity in the lab frame, $v_{\mathrm{esc, lab}}$.

The differential rate in \Eq{eq:dRdEr_general} is determined by the experimental setup, the DM astrophysical and particle properties, the nuclear properties of the target material, and the DM--nucleus interaction.\footnote{Throughout this paper we use $T$ to denote the nuclear target and $N$ to denote a nucleon, either neutron $n$ or proton $p$} For the purposes of this study, we set the astrophysical parameters to the following values \cite{Bovy:2013raa,Piffl:2013mla}: $\rho_\chi=0.3$ GeV/cm$^3$; $v_{\mathrm{esc}} = 533$ km/sec (in the Galactic frame), and assume that $f(\mathrm{\mbox{\bf{v}}})$ is a Maxwellian distribution in the Galactic frame, with a rms speed of $155$ km/sec and a mean speed equal to the Sun's rotational velocity around the Galactic center, $v_\textrm{lag}=220$ km/sec.

The underlying particle physics interaction determines the calculation of the recoil rate through the differential scattering cross section ${d\sigma_T}/{dE_R}$ \cite{Gluscevic:2015sqa,Gresham:2014vja}. This quantity has a normalization (in units of cm${}^2$) which is a free parameter of the model. Different interactions display different functional dependences on $E_R$ and $v$, as discussed in detail in Refs.~\cite{Gluscevic:2015sqa,Gresham:2014vja} and summarized below in \Sec{subsec:momentum_velocity}.

The total rate $R$ of nuclear recoil events (per unit time and unit mass) is given by the integral of the differential rate within the nuclear--recoil energy window $\cE$ of a given experiment\footnote{For simplicity, we assume unit efficiency of detection within the analysis window, and rescale individual experimental exposures to take this assumption into account when choosing experimental parameters to represent the capabilities of G2 experiments.}, $R(t)=\int_\cE \frac{dR}{dE_R dt} dE_R$. In turn, the total expected number of events $\langle N_\mathrm{tot}\rangle$ for a fiducial target mass $\cM_\textrm{fid}$, in experiment that started observation at a time $t_1$ and ended at a time $t_2$, is given by
\beq \label{eq:totevents}
\langle N_\mathrm{tot}\rangle =  \cM_\textrm{fid} \int\limits_{t_1}^{t_2} \int\limits_\cE  \frac{dR}{dE_R dt}(E_R,t)\,dE_R \,dt.
\eeq


\subsection{Momentum and Velocity Dependence}
\label{subsec:momentum_velocity}

Traditional focus on the two standard scattering cases, spin--independent (SI) and spin--dependent (SD) scattering (the former involves coherent contributions from the entire nucleus, resulting in a cross section that scales quadratically with nucleon number, while the latter scales with the total nuclear spin), obscures the richness of phenomenologies which can arise when these two standard interactions are suppressed \cite{} \sjwtt{Sam, do you have a good ref for this?}. Here we summarize the effective field theory that catalogues all possible energy and velocity dependencies of the cross section, and thus delineates the modeling space for interactions probed by these experiments in most general terms. In the \Sec{sec:models}, we highlight several well--motivated examples of interesting scattering models which we use in this work to examine the extent to which including time information can enhance identification of the underlying DM model.

%The target nucleus in direct detection experiments is chosen to have large principal quantum numbers according to which the experiment is categorized as spin--independent (SI) or spin-dependent. Spin-independent scattering involves coherent contributions from the entire nucleus, such that the cross section scales quadratically with nucleon number. This is to be contrasted with the spin-dependent rate which scales with the total nuclear spin, a quantity that is typically concentrated in a single nucleon. Thus, experiments are usually based on elements selected for having large $A$ or large total spin, with the former experiments dubbed ``spin-independent'' and exhibiting reach to smaller absolute values of the overall cross section. \sjwtt{Guys... I'm gonna want to come back and address this paragraph. I understand the gist and I'm not vehemently opposed to having something like this, but the wording as it just doesn't seem correct.} 

%Such simplistic classification obscures the fact that this dichotomy strictly refers to the dependence on nuclear spin, and does not necessarily imply a hierarchy of expected rates. Many responses sensitive to a diversity of nuclear ``charges'' and ``currents'' can be classified as ``spin-independent'' \cite{Fitzpatrick:2012ix}, most of which are suppressed by small kinematic factors. Suppression of spin-independent scattering can lead to novel signatures in direct detection experiments. Consistently counting the pertinent small factors, and thus acquiring intuition for what might be seen in future experiments, requires a proper effective field theory expansion. 


%The function $\frac{d\sigma_T}{dE_R} (E_R,v)$ in \Eq{eq:dRdEr_general} contains the interesting particle physics of the DM--nucleus scattering and determines the energy and time dependence of the observable recoil event rate. 
The effective field theory of DM direct detection \cite{Fitzpatrick:2012ix, Anand:2013yka} relies on an expansion in two small kinematic variables: $|\vec q|/m_N$, where $\vec q$ is the change in momentum of the DM particle during the scattering, and $|\vec v_\perp|$ is the orthogonal component of the relative velocity of the initial--state particles. For an incoming (outgoing) DM three--momentum $\vec p(\vec p\,')$, incoming (outgoing) nuclear three--momentum $\vec k$ $(\vec k')$, and a reduced mass $\mu_{\chi N} \equiv m_\chi m_N/(m_\chi +m_N)$, these factors are $\vec q=\vec p\,'-\vec p=\vec k-\vec k'$, and $\vec v_\perp=\frac{\vec p}{m_\chi}-\frac{\vec k}{m_N}+\frac{\vec q}{2\mu_{\chi N}}$, respectively.
The momentum transfer is directly related to the nuclear recoil energy as $\vec{q}^{\, 2} =2m_TE_R$. \sjwtt{We use $m_T$ and $m_N$, for effectively the same thing, we can reduce this to one?}

These expansion parameters are of the same order of magnitude, but it is important to note that they manifest differently in the observables of the scattering events (see \eg \cite{Gluscevic:2015sqa} for a comprehensive discussion). In particular, terms that enter at higher order in $|\vec q|/m_N$ deliver a vanishing event rate at both small and large momentum transfer (or recoil--energy), with a maximum rate at some intermediate recoil energy, producing a ``turnover feature'' in the recoil--energy spectrum. Light mediator models can alternatively contain factors of $m_N/|\vec q|$, producing a steep enhancement of the recoil spectra at low values of $\ER$. On the other hand, higher--order terms in $| \vec v_\perp|$ produce rates that monotonically decrease with energy and are quantitatively similar to observables produced by the standard SI and SD interactions. 

As was demonstrated by Ref.~\cite{Gluscevic:2015sqa}, interactions that feature different momentum dependence can be differentiated from each other using a single nuclear target, provided a sufficiently large number of events are observed; however, the latter class of models---those that differ only by the power of velocity dependence---are far more difficult to disentangle, leaving substantial degeneracy between well--motivated interaction models. In the following, we develop an intuition for how this degeneracy might be overcome, using annual modulation and time dependence of the scattering rate.

\subsection{Time Dependence}
\label{subsec:time}

In \Eq{eq:dRdEr_general}, the differential rate of nuclear recoils is explicitly denoted as depending on time, which arises as a consequence of the Earth's harmonic motion around the Sun. This motion causes the DM phase space observable by direct detection experiments to modulate, resulting in a time dependent scattering rate that is expected to vary with time on the order of a few percent. The expected phase and amplitude of the modulation depend strongly on the astrophysical and particle properties of DM (see \eg \cite{Green:2000ga,Gelmini:2000dm,DelNobile:2015nua}). For example, it was recently shown that the gravitational focusing of DM by the Sun produces a characteristic energy dependence in the phase of the modulation~\cite{Danby01021957,Griest:1987vc,Sikivie:2002bj,Alenazi:2006wu,Lee:2013wza,DelNobile:2015nua}. 


%This ``annual modulation'' of the DM particle ``wind'', as observed in the lab frame, is additionally affected by ``gravitational focusing'' of DM particles in the Sun's potential well \cite{Danby01021957,Griest:1987vc,Sikivie:2002bj,Alenazi:2006wu}. Overall, these effects are expected to give rise to an energy--dependent modulation of the total nuclear recoil rate in direct detection experiments.

\end{figure*}
To illustrate the qualitative differences of the annual modulation and recoil spectrum arising from interactions with a differing functional dependence on the momentum transfer and DM velocity, we plot in \Fig{fig:diff_rate_comp} a comparison of the energy spectra (left column) and time dependence of the rate (right column) for several DM-nuclei interactions; specifically, we plot these observables for the standard SI (teal), anapole (orange), and heavy--mediator electric dipole (ED--heavy) (violet) interactions (see \Sec{sec:models} for a more detailed definition of the models). The top (bottom) panels of \Fig{fig:diff_rate_comp} correspond to a 500 (20) GeV DM particle.  Instead of showing the differential rate as a function of time in the right--hand panels we show the residuals, defined as the fractional deviation from the time--averaged energy--integrated rate. Note, for example, that the energy spectra for the SI and ED--heavy interactions are distinct in a way that the SI and anapole interactions are not; thus, discerning the SI and anapole hypotheses using the energy spectrum alone is quite challenging, given even the most optimistic expectations for the Poisson noise \cite{Gluscevic:2015sqa}. 

However, the annual--modulation signatures of the SI and anapole models can be very different, owing to a non--trivial ($\sim | \vec v_\perp|^2$) velocity dependence of the anapole cross section. This non-trivial velocity dependence alters the velocity integral in \Eq{eq:dRdEr_general}, and consequently leads to a different time dependence of the total event rate (see Figs.~1-3 of \cite{DelNobile:2015rmp} for overview of time-dependent behavior of various $v$-dependent cross sections). For large enough DM mass, this can produce a nearly {\it opposite modulation phase} between the standard SI scenario and the anapole case! Furthermore, differential cross sections which contain multiple non--negligible terms with different velocity dependences can produce annual modulation signals entirely unique to a given target element~\cite{DelNobile:2015tza,DelNobile:2015rmp}. The time variation of the rate, and thus the differences between the annual modulation produced by these models, is typically expected to be small -- on the order of a few percent. Nonetheless, we will show in the following that this small difference in the characteristic time dependence of the rate for different models can be used to supplement the information contained in the energy spectrum and substantially aid the process of model selection on single nuclide targets employed by future experiments. In the following analysis, we incorporate the effect of gravitational focusing by the Sun following the procedure of~\cite{Lee:2013wza}. 


\section{Distinguishing Scattering Models}\label{sec:procedure}
Our approach, outlined below, follows that of Ref.~\cite{Gluscevic:2015sqa}. We being in Sec.~\ref{sec:models} by identifying various realistic models which produce DM-nuclei interactions with a similar dependence on the momentum transfer but a different dependence on the DM velocity (\ie models with nearly degenerate recoil spectra but qualitatively different annual modulation). Assuming a particular DM model and mass, we simulate events in future direct detection experiments assuming optimistically that the true cross section is at the current 90\% confidence level. This procedure is repeated for many realizations in order to capture in the impact of Poisson noise on future data analyses (refer to \Sec{sec:sims} for specific details). We then perform a Bayesian model selection analysis between two models with nearly degenerate recoil spectrum but differing time dependence in order to quantitatively assess the impact that including time information may potentially have on proper model identification. The details of this statistical procedure are outline in \Sec{sec:stats}.
 


\subsection{Summary of Models}\label{sec:models}
In this section, we illustrate a generic model which can give rise to various DM-nuclei interactions that contain non-standard dependencies on the momentum transfer and DM velocity. We emphasize that the discussion below is simply one illustration that gives rise to operators that we are interested in studying, and is by no means an exhaustive list of models which can lead to these types of interactions.

In order to assess the benefit from considering time dependence of the scattering signals in direct--detection analyses with future data, we focus on a generic extension of the Standard Model, represented by a hidden $U(1)'$ that has several charged fermions $X_i$ and a heavy gauge boson $A'_\mu$ with mass $M$ that kinetically mixes with the Standard Model photon. At high energies, the Lagrangian contains
\beq \label{eq:UV-model}
\cL \supset -  m_X \bar X_i X^i + i \bar X_i \slashed D_{ij} X^j  - \frac12 M^2 A'_\mu A'^\mu  - \frac14 F'_{\mu \nu} F'^{\mu \nu} - \frac\epsilon2 F'_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} \, ,
\eeq
where $F_{\mu \nu}$ and $F'_{\mu \nu}$ are the field strength tensor of the photon and the heavy gauge boson, respectively (\ie $F_{\mu \nu} \equiv \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\mu A_\nu$). At low energies, the $A'_\mu$ and most $X$ particles are integrated out. We assume a mass hierarchy that results in an electrically neutral fermion $\chi$ as the lightest degree of freedom in the dark sector, thereby providing a DM candidate. Because of the kinetic mixing, the state $\chi$ couples to the Standard Model nucleon current \cite{Gresham:2014vja},
\beq \label{eq:current}
\cJ_\mu = \partial^\alpha F_{\alpha \mu} = e \sum_{n,p} \bar N \pL Q_N \frac{K_\mu}{2m_N} -\widetilde \mu_N \frac{i \sigma_{\mu \nu}q^\nu}{2m_N} \pR N,
\eeq 
where $Q_{p(n)}=1(0)$ are the nucleon charges in units of the electron charge $e$, $K_\mu/2 = (k_\mu + k'_\mu)/2$ is the average nucleon momentum, and $\tilde{\mu}_N = {\text{magnetic moment} \over \text{nuclear magneton}}$ is the dimensionless magnetic moment of the nucleon.

The details of the masses and charges of the dark fermions $X_i$ that constitute or couple to the DM $\chi$ will determine interaction that is measured in an experiment. We will use $\cO_\chi^\mu$ to denote the Lorentz-vector fermion bilinear that couples to the current in \Eq{eq:current}. Because we assume $\chi$ is electromagnetically neutral, the possible $\cO_\chi^\mu$ are \cite{Gresham:2014vja, Gluscevic:2015sqa}
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:photon-DM-ops}
\cO_{\rm \chi, Anapole}^\mu & = & g^{\rm Anapole}\bar \chi \gamma^\mu \gamma_5 \chi, \\
\cO_{\rm \chi, MD}^\mu & = & \frac{g^{\rm MD}}{\Lambda}\bar \chi i \sigma^{\mu \nu} q_\nu \chi ,\\
\cO_{\rm \chi, ED}^\mu & = & \frac{g^{\rm ED}}{\Lambda} \bar \chi i \sigma^{\mu \nu} \gamma_5 q_\nu \chi.
\end{eqnarray}
If we had alternatively taken the mass of the new gauge boson to be small relative to the characteristic scale of momentum transfer, the dipole interactions would be described by:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:photon-DM-ops}
\cO_{\rm \chi, MD}^\mu & = & g^{\rm MD}\bar \chi i \sigma^{\mu \nu}  \chi ,\\
\cO_{\rm \chi, ED}^\mu & = & g^{\rm ED} \bar \chi i \sigma^{\mu \nu} \gamma_5 \chi.
\end{eqnarray}

As stated above, the interaction operator for $\chi$ is determined by the dynamics of the $X$ fermion(s). The anapole current in \Eq{eq:photon-DM-ops} will arise if charged $X^\pm$ states condense to form a neutral Majorana state $\chi$ \cite{Bagnasco:1993st}. The dipole currents form if an electromagnetically neutral $X^0$ couples to an electromagnetically charged pair of partner $X^\pm$ particles (of appropriate spin) \cite{Weiner:2012gm}. The scale at which the charged $X$ states are integrated out is $\Lambda$.

The simplicity of the model in \Eq{eq:UV-model} and the rich assortment of momentum and velocity dependencies that appear in the associated EFT operators illustrates the generic nature of these interactions. We list the EFT classification of these operators in \Tab{tab:operators}. (This is an abbreviated version of the more exhaustive table that appeared in \cite{Gluscevic:2015sqa}, using results of \cite{Gresham:2014vja, Gluscevic:2015sqa}). In this work, we will focus on differentiating DM-nuclei interactions that have the same momentum scaling but different velocity dependence.

For our simulations, we consider interactions discussed in the previous Section (summarized in Table~\ref{tab:operators}), and perform our analysis for the case of a $20$ GeV, $125$ GeV, and $500$ GeV DM particle. In all our simulations, we optimistically set the cross section to be the value maximally allowed by LUX~\cite{Akerib:2016vxi} \footnote{We note that LUX currently produces the most constraining bounds on the models and masses of considered in this paper, although the constraint from PandaX-II is only marginally weaker~\cite{Tan:2016zwf}.}. Our initial analysis focuses on G2 experiments, specifically experiments employing xenon, germanium, and fluorine targets. Since fluorine experiments measure only the energy integrated rate, information on recoil energies of individual events are neglected in the analysis of this experiment.  The exposure and energy window of our mock experiments are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:experiments}. Throughout the analysis we assume unit detection efficiency and zero backgrounds. In addition to the aforementioned, we also consider the potential reach of a Generation 3 (G3) xenon experiment, as well as various xenon experiments with exposures lying somewhere between G2 and G3 (the properties of which are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:experiments}).  The predicted number of events for each interaction considered in these mock experiments are shown in Table~\ref{tab:pred_events}. 

For each simulation, the observed number of events is obtained by randomly selecting from a Poisson distribution with a mean given by the predicted number of events calculated using \Eq{eq:totevents}. The recoil energy and time of each event is then obtained by applying a rejection sampling algorithm to the two-dimensional differential scattering rate. This procedure is repeated for $\cO(50)$ simulations properly understand the variability of results arising from Poisson noise.

\subsection{Analysis method}\label{sec:stats}

Within the Bayesian inference framework, the probability that the data $\vec{X}$ assigns to a given model $\cM_j$ is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:probs}
P(\cM_j) = \frac{\cE_j(\vec{X}|\cM_j)}{\sum_i \cE_i(\vec{X}|\cM_i)} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $\cE(\vec{X}|\cM)$ is the evidence of model $\cM$, defined by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:evidence}
\cE(\vec{X}|\cM) = \int d\Theta \, \cL(\vec{X}|\Theta,\cM) \, p(\Theta,\cM) \, ,
\end{equation}
and is intuitively understood to be the factor required to normalize the posterior $\cP$, \ie
\begin{equation}\label{eq:posterior}
\cP(\Theta | \vec{X}, \cM) = \frac{\cL(\vec{X}|\Theta,\cM)\, p(\Theta,\cM)}{\cE(\vec{X}|\cM)} \, . 
\end{equation}
Here, $\cL(\vec{X}|\Theta,\cM)$ is the likelihood, \ie the probability of obtaining the data, given a particular model $\cM$ and parameters $\Theta$ (for the purpose of this analysis $\Theta = \cbL m_\chi, \sigma_p \cbR$), and $p(\Theta, \cM)$ is the prior. In order to remain as agnostic as possible, we take wide priors in both $m_\chi$ and $\sigma_p$\footnote{Log priors are taken for both $m_\chi$ and $\sigma_p$, spanning $1-3000$ GeV in mass and $7$ orders of magnitude in cross section.}. In our analysis we use an unbinned extended likelihood function of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:likelihood}
\cL(\vec{X}|\Theta,\cM) = \frac{\mu^N}{N!} \, e^{-\mu} \, \prod_{x_i \in \vec{X}}\, \frac{1}{\mu} \, \frac{dR}{d\ER dt} \bigg|_{\ER,t \, = \, x_i} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is the predicted number of events, $N$ is the number of observed events, and the product runs over all the normalized differential rate evaluated at the $\ER$ and $t$ values of each observed event $x_i \equiv \cbL E_{R,i} \, , \, t_i \cbR$. When time or $\ER$ information is neglected, the differential rate is implicitly understood to be averaged over that variable. 

In summary, we being our analysis by simulating data for an experiment (or experiments) assuming a particular DM model, mass, and cross section (see Sec.~\ref{sec:sims}). We then use PyMultiNest to reconstruct the posterior defined in \Eq{eq:posterior}, and subsequently calculate the evidence for various DM models~\cite{pymultinest,Feroz:2008xx}\footnote{Multinest runs are performed with 2000 live points, an evidence tolerance of 0.1, and a sampling efficiency of 0.3.}. Once the evidence of various models has been computed, one can estimate the probability of successfully being able to identify the true model using \Eq{eq:probs}. This procedure is then repeated for $\cO(50)$ simulations to assess the variability in successful model identification arising from Poisson fluctuations. A model is said to be correctly identified if the probability determined using \Eq{eq:probs} is large. For the purpose of this paper, we define the boundary for successful model identification at $P \geq 90\%$. The primary quantity of interest for future direct detection experiments is then the fraction of simulations which lead to a successful model identification.    

Instead of plotting the individual probabilities of each simulation, we apply kernel density estimation (KDE) with a Gaussian kernel to determine the distribution functions of these probabilities. For of the results listed in the following section, we plot the KDE distribution for each experimental combination both with and without time, and determine the fractional success rate by integrating the distribution above the 90\% threshold.

\end{figure}


We first examine the extent to which including time information in the analysis of G2 experiments can help break degeneracy between models with the same velocity dependence, using a study case of the SI and anapole interactions. Specifically, we simulate future data for the SI and anapole interactions and fit each simulation with these two models. We then use the Bayesian evidence generated by analyzing the fit of the two models and compute the probability of properly identifying the true underlying model (used to create a given simulation ensemble), as described in \Sec{sec:stats}. We then derive the probability distribution function (PDF) of identifying the true underlying model from the 50 simulations that used the same input model and parameters.\footnote{Note that, since we only consider two competing models, a PDF peaked at around $50\%$ means that the data is most likely to be agnostic between the two models, \ie they produce comparable fits. This is the most pessimistic outcome possible. A tail of the distribution at high probabilities, or a PDF shift in that direction, signifies improved model identification.} \Fig{fig:gen2} shows the results of this exercise for the anapole (left column) and SI (right column) interactions, analyzing data observed in a xenon-target experiment alone (brown) and in conjunction with a germanium- and fluorine-target experiments (teal). DM particle masses used in the simulations are: $500$ GeV (top panels), $125$ GeV (middle panels), and $20$ GeV (bottom panels), with cross sections set to their respective current upper limits. We show the results obtained both neglecting (dashed) and including (solid) time information of the nuclear recoils. 

Consistent with the results of~\cite{Gluscevic:2015sqa}, we find that the two models can be confidently distinguished for a signal close to the current detection threshold, provided G2--level exposure on xenon and a detection with a fluorine experiment, but only if data from these experiments are jointly analyzed (xenon and germanium experiments are not complementary in the sense that a joint analysis does not significantly improve prospects for model selection, and thus we do not display results for this case). For a low--mass DM particle (20 GeV), the improvement upon combining these two types of experiments is drastic: the PDF of possible model--selection outcomes entirely shifts to a delta--function at 100$\%$ probability in favor of the right model. For intermediate and high masses, the prospects are still visibly improved, but not very optimistic (at best on the level of $\sim$20$\%$ success rate), mostly due to the reduced scattering rate on fluorine.

Comparison of no-time and with-time analyses, displayed in dashed and solid lines respectively, demonstrates that inclusion of time information only negligibly changes model--selection prospects for G2 level of exposures. Given that G2 experiments will optimistically detect on the order of $\simeq 100$ events, the statistical sample will be insufficient to clearly detect differences in the modulation signal that would otherwise aid differentiation between the two interactions. It is thus not surprising that analyzing G2 data with time has a minimal effect on model selection (see \eg Sec.~4 of \cite{DelNobile:2015nua} for an estimation of the number of events needed for phase measurement).

The question than arises of how many events are needed before the inclusion of time information can significantly help model selection prospects. We address this question in Figs.~\ref{fig:20gev_anapole_XeFull_TNT_GF}--\ref{fig:500gev_anapole_XeFull_TNT_GF} for a xenon-target experiment \footnote{We choose to illustrate this for xenon experiments as they are projected to observe far more events for the interactions considered than their germanium and fluorine based counterparts.}. In these figures, we show the prospects (PDF of possible analysis outcomes) of successful model selection, given different exposures in the same experiment: a 2 (brown), 6 (tan), 20 (light teal), and 40 (teal) ton--year. Simulations used for these figures all assume the anapole interaction (the results for the SI interaction are qualitatively similar and we defer the SI analogues of these figures to Appendix A), and a DM mass of 20, 125, and 500 GeV, respectively. Results are shown for analyses that neglect (dashed) and include (solid) the time dependence of the rate. 

From these figures, we see that the addition of time information drastically improves prospects for successful model selection in the case of light DM particle (the solid--line PDFs are substantially shifted to the right in \Fig{fig:20gev_anapole_XeFull_TNT_GF}). In spite of this, a G3 xenon experiment has only a $\simeq 16\%$ chance of disentangling these two interactions. \Fig{fig:diff_rate_comp} gives an intuition for interpreting this outcome: both the recoil spectra and the phase of the modulation of the SI and anapole interactions (measured in a xenon-target experiment) are more degenerate for light DM particles; thus, even when including time information in the analysis, a single target experiment still must observe a large even of events in order to successfully distinguish between these models.

At larger DM particle masses, however, the recoil energy spectra are less degenerate, allowing for better model discrimination at fixed exposure. This is, in part, because of a $\simeq 5$ month difference in phase between the modulation produce by the SI and anapole interactions (see again \Fig{fig:diff_rate_comp}). Figs.~\ref{fig:125gev_anapole_XeFull_TNT_GF} and \ref{fig:500gev_anapole_XeFull_TNT_GF} indeed confirm that heavier DM candidates allow for better model discrimination of these models, particularly when time is included in the analysis. From these figures, we see that including time in the analysis can improve model selection in G3 experiments by as much as $\simeq 30\%$ for heavy DM, where the phases of the modulation signal for these two interactions may be misaligned by as much as $\simeq 5$ months. Finally, it is important to keep in mind that all the results displayed in these figures assume the most optimistic number of observed recoil events. Thus, despite the improvement in model selection obtained through the inclusion of time information, it is likely that model selection with G3 experiments will still be challenging using a single target; most likely, the experiments will need to exploit target complimentarily and perform joint likelihood analyses in order to fully break the degeneracy observed between these types of models and ensure the highest chance of correctly identifying the interaction at hand. 

The goal of this work was primarily a quantitative assessment of whether time information can be exploited in future direct--detection analyses to break degeneracies in the recoil spectra of different interaction models---and SI and anapole interactions provided a particularly illuminating study case for this purpose. However, the main conclusions presented in this Section hold for other sets of interaction models as well, and we now briefly illustrate this point. In \Figs{fig:125gev_Mag.dip.heavy_XeFull_TNT_GF}{fig:125gev_Mag.dip.light_XeFull_TNT_GF} we consider a comparison of the magnetic dipole and electric dipole interactions for a $125$ GeV DM particle, assuming a heavy (\Fig{fig:125gev_Mag.dip.heavy_XeFull_TNT_GF}) and light (\Fig{fig:125gev_Mag.dip.light_XeFull_TNT_GF}) mediator. As before, we consider putative detections in future xenon experiments with exposures varying from 2 to 40 ton--years. The results are rather similar to the SI and anapole comparison in that G3 experiments can expect a $\simeq 20\%$ improvement in model selection when time is included in the analysis, but again necessitate target complementarity to have a high chance of confidently differentiating these interactions.

\section{Summary and Discussion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We have considered here the potential impact of using time information in the likelihood analysis of data from future direct detection experiments in order to break degeneracies between the recoil energy spectra of different DM--baryon interactions. Specifically, we performed a statistical assessment of the prospects for successful Bayesian model selection between different interaction models, using an ensemble of simulations that account for the impact of Poisson fluctuations on possible analysis outcomes. 

As a case study, we compared the standard spin--independent interaction and anapole DM, but also demonstrated that the main findings hold for other degenerate interaction models as well. We explored three different dark--matter masses, and focused specifically on the most optimistic case where the cross sections for all interactions saturate current upper limits. 

We found that even under the most optimistic of circumstances, including time information in the analysis of G2 direct detection does not significantly improve prospects for distinguishing between models with degenerate recoil spectrum. Rather, correct model identification in G2 experiments will almost certainly require measurements and combined analyses on multiple target elements. We found that for the inclusion of time information to significantly increase chances for successful model selection (by $\cO(10)\%$), given a single target element, $\cO(1000)$ events must be observed for a 20 GeV, and $\cO(500)$ for a 500 GeV DM particle. These numbers are consistent with the `back-of-the-envelope' calculations performed in \cite{DelNobile:2015nua}. Furthermore, even if time information is exploited in G3 xenon experiments, target complementarity must also be exploited to unequivocally differentiate between different models. We emphasize that our analysis in maximally optimistic in the sense that our analysis uses the largest allowed cross section and completely neglecting potential backgrounds. More conservative choices would certainly reduce the ability of future experiments to properly identify the underlying interactions.


In the event of a putative signal, direct detection experiments will be charged with the difficult task of illuminating the high energy behavior of DM solely from the observed low--energy recoils. This is a particularly daunting task in light of the fact that many feasible DM models produce nearly degenerate recoil spectra. Exploiting all of the information available, including the time information of nuclear recoils, will be necessary to make definitive statements regarding the true particle nature of DM.

We present in Figs.~\ref{fig:20gev_SI_Higgs_XeFull_TNT_GF}--\ref{fig:500gev_SI_Higgs_XeFull_TNT_GF} the model selection prospects for various exposures on a xenon experiment, including (solid lines) and neglecting (dashed lines) information on the modulation of the recoil rate, and assuming the SI interaction is the true model. Results are shown for $20$ GeV (\Fig{fig:20gev_SI_Higgs_XeFull_TNT_GF}), $125$ GeV (\Fig{fig:125gev_SI_Higgs_XeFull_TNT_GF}), and $500$ GeV (\Fig{fig:500gev_SI_Higgs_XeFull_TNT_GF}) DM particle. Results are similar to those presented in \Sec{sec:results} for the case of the anapole interaction.
